# Blockchain Boilerplate Project

## About
This is a simple blockchain boilerplate project that is useful to developers who want to have a non-opinionated javascript framework to compile, test and deploy Ethereum contracts in Solidity. 

This is a good alternative to learn what frameworks like Truffle do behind the scenes.

## Development Environment Setup
1. `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools@4.0.0` (as Administrator)
2. `npm install -g ganache-cli` (formerly known as testrpc)

## Gotchas
Make sure that you are running the `1.0.0-beta.37` version of web3, otherwise it will break.
